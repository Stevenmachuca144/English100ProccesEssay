Coding and hosting your first Landing Page
Hello World! This is what you as a beginner programmer will print to the console when learning your first programming language, how exciting, I hope you are ready. First, what exactly is code?  Programmers have been writing code to create an application that solves problems and inconveniences, these applications run and are updated on mobile, desktop or tablet devices. The best way to approach learning to code is to have an idea in mind of an application that can be used for your needs and people's needs, take a moment to think about an application or app. Once you have thought about an idea it's time to execute, sit down at a computer and get ready! There are lots of new technologies like chat gpt for example that have made the field of computer science very much more approachable for newcomers.

First we shall begin with the setup, you will need a computer as modern as you can, Microsoft or apple is personal preference, both are used to produce code efficiently by skilled programmers, for reference I use apple. Now that you have a computer you will need to download various softwares to develop your webpage from scratch on your computer. First download VS code, this is a code editor, it is the user interface that all developers have to use for their workflow, next comes git, git is a version control system, its role is to allow you to save your code that you have written on your machine, to a remote repository on the site GitHub.  Github is free and open source meaning they encourage everyone to start learning code regardless of skill level and encourage you to eventually contribute back to the community by developing more open source services for people like you and me. All issues regarding installation of these two technologies on your machine can be solved using the documentation on their respective sites, google and chat gpt can be of assistance as well getting your setup complete. Now comes the coding. 

Begin by creating a folder on your machine, name it english100ProccesEssay, next open terminal, navigate to english100ProccesEssay folder, run cd english100ProccesEssay in terminal, once inside folder using terminal, run git init to initialize git repository, next, open vs code and add a index.html file in the root directory. We will be utilizing modern technologies like chat gpt to make us exponentially more efficient, open chat gpt, and ask “give me a index.html file for a landing page”
